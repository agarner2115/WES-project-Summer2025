# WES-project-Summer2025
This is the repository for my team's WES Intern Challenge for the Summer 2025. Included is the modules for our BME280 sensor, AI camera, ground station, and LoRa radio. The purpose of the challenge is to collect weather data, during a scheduled flight, and store the data into a database for future analysis. We used a Raspberry Pi 4 and a Raspberry Pi 400. Our BME280 sensor is used to collect temperature (Â°C), pressure (hPa), altitude, humidity, and the time of data collection. We will be using a LoRa radio to transmit data to our ground station. From there, our ground station will print the data received from the BME280, and it will be plotted live for the judges. We configured the code to run in a headless mode. Upon startup, the sensor would immediately begin reading, the camera would immediately begin capturing, and the LoRa would begin waiting for a message.
We were also tasked with 3D printing the payload that will hold our Raspberry Pi during the flight. The payload was required to be the center of gravity for the drone, and it could not exceed 2 pounds.
